# Car-Sales-Prediction
This project develops a regression model to predict the amount customers are willing to pay for a car based on attributes like annual salary, credit card debt, and net worth. The goal is to establish a relationship between Annual Salary and Car Purchase Amount to assist car salesmen in making data-driven decisions.
