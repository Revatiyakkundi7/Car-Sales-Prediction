# Car-Sales-Prediction
This project develops a regression model to predict the amount customers are willing to pay for a car based on attributes like annual salary, credit card debt, and net worth. The goal is to establish a relationship between Annual Salary and Car Purchase Amount to assist car salesmen in making data-driven decisions.

## Dataset
Customer Name <br>
Customer Email <br>
Country <br>
Gender <br>
Age <br>
Annual Salary <br>
Credit Card Debt <br>
Net Worth <br>
Car Purchase Amount (Target Variable) <br>

## Objective
Build a regression model to predict Car Purchase Amount, focusing on Annual Salary as the key predictor

## Approach
**Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, normalize data, and encode categorical variables. <br>
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze correlations and visualize relationships. <br> 
**Model Development**: Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Networks) and evaluate them using R-squared, MSE, and MAE. <br>
**Model Optimization & Validation**: Tune hyperparameters, perform cross-validation, and deploy the best model.<br>

## Technologies Used
* Python, Pandas, NumPy<br>
* Matplotlib, Seaborn<br>
* Scikit-learn, Keras<br>

## Expected Outcome
A regression model that predicts a customerâ€™s car purchase amount based on financial background.

## Future Enhancements
Add features like credit score and loan history
Test additional models
Deploy as a web or mobile app
